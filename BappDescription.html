<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> The extension requires Semgrep CLI to be installed in your machine.</p>

<p>The current project provides a Burp Suite extension to allow users to include Semgrep results to extend the checks in use by the passive scanner. By visiting repositories that collect Semgrep rules, it is possible to verify the large number of rules related to the front-end environment written by the community.</p>

<p>By using this extension, Burp Suite users can include the Semgrep rules YAML files and define the scope of the analysis.</p>

<p>Main features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>multiple tabs to use different Semgrep rules with different scopes</li>
	<li>select files or directories containing Semgrep rules in YAML format</li>
	<li>define a scope by specifing what can be or not be present in the response header/body</li>
	<li>deactivate the checks without unloading the plugin</li>
</ul>
